<h1 align="center">Chatty RS</h1>

Introducing Chatty-rs, a delightful and straightforward 1:1 chat example built with an all-Rust stack! 🦀 The frontend is powered by Yew, the middleware by Trunk, and the backend by Actix. Plus, we've got Tailwind CSS sprinkled on top for a touch of style. 🎨 Trunk will automatically ask Tailwind to check for any new classes to add to the .css file.

Ready to give it a whirl? Try our demo version: [Chatty-rs Demo 🚀](https://chatty.19ninety2.com/) Currently down (my home server exploded).

To set up Chatty-rs on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository. 🖥️
2. Navigate to `./chatty-rs/clients` and type trunk serve. 🌐
3. Head over to `./chatty-rs/server` and enter cargo run. 🏃‍♂️
4. Open your browser and visit `http://127.0.0.1:8080/` 🌟
5. Hold on! There's a bit more to do. 😅

You'll need to have trunk installed, which requires cargo, which in turn means you'll need rustup. On top of that, the tailwindcss in the repository is specific to my Mac, so follow the instructions here to download a version for your local machine: [Tailwindcss Standalone CLI](https://tailwindcss.com/blog/standalone-cli).
