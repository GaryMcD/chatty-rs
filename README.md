# chatty-rs

This is a simple 1:1 chat example built with a Rust stack. The frontend is Yew, middleware is trunk, backend is Actix. Tailwind CSS is used for styling on the frontend. Trunk will automatically have Tailwind check for any new classes to add into the `.css` file.

To run locally on your machine.

1. Clone the repository.
2. Navigate to `./chatty-rs/clients` and enter `trunk serve`.
3. Navigate to `./chatty-rs/server` and enter `cargo run`.
4. Navigate in your browser to `http://127.0.0.1:8080/`

Oh! Wait! - that doesn't work.

So you also need to have `trunk` installed, which means you need `cargo` installed, which means you need `rustup`. In addition to this the `tailwindcss` in the repository is specific to my Mac, so you will need to follow the instructions here to download a version for your local machine: [Tailwindcss Standalone CLI](https://tailwindcss.com/blog/standalone-cli).

Example of what it looks like.
